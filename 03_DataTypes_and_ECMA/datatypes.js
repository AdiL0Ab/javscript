 Datatypes :-
  1. Number => 2 to power 53 // it supports both integer and float value 
  2. bigint => The range of BigInt is not fixed but limited by the available memory of the system. 
  In theory, it can store arbitrarily large integers, both positive and negative. 
  There is no defined upper or lower bound on BigInt values, unlike Number values,
   which are constrained by floating-point precision.
  3. string => ""
  4. boolean => true/false 
  5. null => standalone value
  6. undefined => value is not defined
  7. symbol => when we talk about unique 

  8. object
